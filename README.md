# ipstream
Used for the St Stephen's College Stage Management Team. We use this simple python script to connect remove IP cameras. Due to the limitations of our team, we do not own the IP cameras, thus we decided to create a makeshift IP camera with the use of Raspberry Pis and GoPros. This system is infinitely scalable and can be used in many different applications. 

Unfortunately, this program is only a one-time use case and due to that this will be the final version of the program. There will be no more updates, unless extremely important problems are found. Please feel free to submit any patches if needed.
